## Rod Cutting Problem
### Problem: Find best way to cut a rod of length n
### Given: rod of length n

Assume that each length rod has a price pi

Find best set of cuts to get maximum revenue (ie ri/sub>
Each cut is integer length
Can use any number of cuts, from 0 to nâˆ’1
No cost for a cut
Finding an optimal solution requires solutions to multiple subproblems

### Given the rod values below:
Given a rod of length 4, what is the maximum revenue: ri
Given a rod of length 8, what is the maximum revenue: ri
### Example rod lengths and values:

```
length i	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8
price pi	1	5	8	9	10	17	17	20
```
